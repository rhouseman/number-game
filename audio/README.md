# Audio Files

This directory should contain the following sound effect files:

- `launch.mp3` - Sound when Numby is launched
- `peg_hit.mp3` - Sound when Numby hits a peg
- `number_hit.mp3` - Sound when Numby collects a number node
- `day_complete.mp3` - Sound when a day is completed successfully
- `game_over.mp3` - Sound when the game ends (sun explodes)
- `synergy.mp3` - Sound when item synergy is activated
- `special_node.mp3` - Sound when hitting a special node
- `achievement.mp3` - Sound when unlocking an achievement

Note: If these files are not present, the game will use simple synthesized sounds as a fallback using the Web Audio API.
