# Background Music Files

This directory should contain the following background music tracks in MP3 format:

- `main_theme.mp3` - Main title screen music (retro synth wave style)
- `gameplay.mp3` - Background music while playing the game
- `shop.mp3` - Background music for the shop screen
- `game_over.mp3` - Background music for the game over screen

If these files are not present, the game will use synthesized retro arcade music as a fallback.
